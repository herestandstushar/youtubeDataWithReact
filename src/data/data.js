Here we will use Python with some packages like Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze a dataset that was collected over 205 days. For each of those days, the dataset contains data about the trending videos of that day. It contains data about more than 40,000 trending videos. We will analyze this data to get insights into YouTube trending videos, to see what is common between these videos. Those insights might also be used by people who want to increase popularity of their videos on YouTube',

What is correlation analysis?Correlation analysis in research is a statistical method used to measure the strength of the linear relationship between two variables and compute their association. Simply put - correlation analysis calculates the level of change in one variable due to the change in the other. A high correlation points to a strong relationship between the two variables, while a low correlation means that the variables are weakly related. When it comes to market research, researchers use correlation analysis to analyze quantitative data collected through research methods like surveys and live polls. They try to identify the relationship, patterns, significant connections, and trends between two variables or datasets. There is a positive correlation between two variabls when an increase in one variable leads to the increase in the other. On the other hand, a negative correlation means that when one variable increases, the other decreases and vice-versa',
